# Amazon KDP Automation

Self-contained skill repo with a local Express + Playwright server. Amazon has **no public KDP metadata API** — this uses saved browser session cookies to call KDP's internal pages and report endpoints.

## Agent responsibilities

**You run everything.** Do not ask the user to run terminal commands.

1. **Ensure setup**: `npm install`, copy `.env.example` → `.env` if missing.
2. **Start the server** if not running: `npm run server:start` (background).
3. **Check session** before any sync/update/download: `npm run status`.
4. **Run all KDP tasks yourself** via npm scripts or the local REST API.
5. **Only pause for the user** during Amazon login — they must complete sign-in (incl. MFA) in visible Chromium. On this headless VPS run `npm run login:remote`, send returned noVNC URL/password, then poll session verification. Use `docs/HEADLESS-LOGIN.md` import only as fallback.

Session persists in `.kdp-session/` (gitignored).

## Sequential operations (required)

When the user asks for **multiple books or multiple write tasks**, process them **one at a time** — never in parallel and never in a single batch request.

**Do:**
- Complete one book (or one metadata/pricing/content update) fully before starting the next
- Use single-book endpoints: `/api/kdp/metadata/update`, `/api/kdp/pricing/update`, `/api/kdp/content/upload`, `/api/kdp/publish` — one HTTP call per book
- Run `npm run publish:book -- spec.json --live` once per title; generate a separate spec JSON per book if needed
- Wait for each call to finish (publish can take several minutes) and verify the result before continuing
- If a step fails, stop or fix that book before moving on — do not fire the rest of the queue blindly

**Do not:**
- Create batch scripts that loop inside one long-running process without user approval
- Call batch API routes (`/batch` endpoints) for multiple titles in one request
- Run multiple publish/upload commands in parallel or in background at the same time
- Open more than one Playwright browser session for KDP writes at once

This avoids HTTP timeouts, Amazon "Server Busy" rate limits, and browser/session conflicts. Batch endpoints exist for advanced use only; **agents should default to sequential single-book calls.**

## Quick commands (agent runs these)

```bash
npm run status                    # session connected?
npm run account:info              # catalog size, vendor code
npm run bookshelf:list            # fast title/format refs
npm run catalog:get               # all titles + ASINs from kdpreports
npm run download:report           # lifetime royalties → output/
npm run parse:report -- file.xlsx # summarize royalties
npm run sync:metadata             # full Bookshelf scrape → cache
npm run sync:book -- ID paperback # refresh one book
npm run metadata:get              # print cached JSON
npm run metadata:export           # cache → Excel
npm run metadata:analyze          # keyword/category audit
npm run update:metadata -- file.json --dry-run
npm run publish:book -- examples/publish-book.example.json
```

## Architecture

```
Browser session (.kdp-session/amazon-kdp.json)
        ↓
Local server (server/src/index.ts) — REST API
        ↓
Playwright session cookies
        ↓
Request-first: kdpreports JSON APIs → HTML GET + parse → browser fallback
        ↓
Global rate limit (random 4-10s before every request)
```

## Read operations

| Operation | Endpoint / command |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Session status | `GET /api/kdp/status` |
| Account info | `GET /api/kdp/account` |
| Reports catalog | `GET /api/kdp/catalog` |
| Bookshelf list (fast) | `GET /api/kdp/bookshelf` |
| Metadata cache | `GET /api/kdp/metadata` |
| Full metadata sync | `POST /api/kdp/metadata/sync` |
| Single book sync | `POST /api/kdp/metadata/sync/:titleId/:format` |
| Metadata audit | `GET /api/kdp/metadata/analyze` |
| Lifetime royalties | `POST /api/kdp/sync` |
| Date-range royalties | `POST /api/kdp/reports/download` |

## Write operations

| Operation | Endpoint |
|-----------|----------|
| Update details (keywords, description, author, flags) | `POST /api/kdp/metadata/update` |
| Batch metadata update | `POST /api/kdp/metadata/update/batch` |
| Update pricing / KDP Select | `POST /api/kdp/pricing/update` |
| Batch pricing update | `POST /api/kdp/pricing/update/batch` |
| Upload interior/cover | `POST /api/kdp/content/upload` |
| Batch upload | `POST /api/kdp/content/upload/batch` |
| Create new title | `POST /api/kdp/titles/create` |
| Update categories | `POST /api/kdp/categories/update` |
| Full publish wizard | `POST /api/kdp/publish` |
| Unpublish live title | `POST /api/kdp/titles/unpublish` |
| Delete draft | `POST /api/kdp/titles/delete` |
| Archive title | `POST /api/kdp/titles/archive` |
| Recovery learnings | `GET /api/kdp/recovery/learnings` |

Always **dry-run one book** before live writes on additional books. Never set `publish: true` without explicit user confirmation.

Batch REST endpoints (`/batch`) are for manual/advanced use. **Agents must not use them for multi-book work** — call the single-book endpoint repeatedly, one title at a time, waiting for each to complete.

## Automatic error recovery

Write flows (details save, content upload, pricing, publish wizard) **retry with recovery** when KDP blocks progress:

- Built-in playbook: dismiss modals, set release date, approve manuscript preview, select cover upload accordion, bypass Server Busy, wait for processing, etc.
- **Learnings file**: `.kdp-session/recovery-learnings.json` — successful error→action pairs are ranked higher on future runs.
- Publish API responses may include `recoveryLog` describing what was tried.

If recovery exhausts retries, read `errors` and `recoveryLog`, then fix the underlying issue (e.g. invalid cover PDF dimensions).

## Rules for agents

1. **Always check session** (`npm run status`) before sync/update. If `connected: false`, run login sub-skill first.
2. **One operation at a time** for writes — see [Sequential operations](#sequential-operations-required). No batch scripts, no parallel publishes, no `/batch` API for multiple titles.
3. **Never commit** `.kdp-session/` or downloaded `.xlsx` files.
4. **Rate limiting**: the server waits a random 4-10s before every KDP page load and API call (`KDP_REQUEST_DELAY_MIN_MS` / `KDP_REQUEST_DELAY_MAX_MS`). Do not bypass this.
5. **Metadata/pricing updates**: dry-run one book, then apply live changes **one book per request**.
6. **Verify saves** by re-reading metadata from KDP (built into update flows).
7. **Categories**: writable via browse node IDs or modal path picker (`POST /api/kdp/categories/update` or publish wizard).
8. **Publish**: use `npm run publish:book` dry-run first; live publish requires `"publish": true` and user confirmation. **One book per `publish:book` invocation.**

# Troubleshooting

## Session expired / 401

```bash
npm run login
npm run status   # wait for connected: true
```

## Server Busy (metadata update fails)

Amazon rate-limits rapid page loads. Symptoms: page title "Server Busy", error `Could not find editable fields`.

**Fix:**
- Default spacing is a random 4-10s before every KDP request (`KDP_REQUEST_DELAY_MIN_MS=4000` / `KDP_REQUEST_DELAY_MAX_MS=10000` in `.env`)
- Increase to `6000` or `8000` if still blocked
- Process **one book at a time** — wait for each operation to finish before the next
- Wait 1–2 minutes if still blocked, then retry

## fetch failed on batch update

Single HTTP request timed out for many books. **Do not batch.** Use `/api/kdp/metadata/update` (or pricing/content/publish) **once per book**, sequentially, and wait for each response before continuing.

## Parallel or scripted multi-book runs

Symptoms: browser closed mid-run, `Target page, context or browser has been closed`, partial uploads, timeouts.

**Fix:**
- Stop any batch script or parallel publish processes
- Run one `publish:book --live` (or single API call) at a time
- Verify each book in KDP before starting the next

## Bookshelf sync count lower than expected

Only rows with editable title-setup links sync. Placeholder rows ("Create Kindle eBook") and incomplete setups are skipped. Check `stats` in sync response.

## Save reported failure but change applied

KDP shows warning banners (e.g. scheduled release, language notice) that are not save failures. Update flow verifies by **re-reading** metadata after save.

## Pricing page not available after content upload

KDP blocks pricing until manuscript (and often cover) finish processing. The publish wizard polls up to **10 minutes** (`waitForPricingPageReady`). If it times out, open the title in KDP manually or re-run:

```bash
npm run publish:book -- output/YourBook.pricing-only.json --live
```

(JSON with `"titleId"`, `"pricing"` only, `"create": false`.)

## Automatic error recovery

When KDP blocks a step (modals, release-date warnings, preview required, Server Busy, etc.), the server:

1. **Collects blockers** from page alerts and body text
2. **Plans recovery actions** from a built-in playbook plus **learned fixes** in `.kdp-session/recovery-learnings.json`
3. **Retries the step** (up to 4–5 attempts) after executing recoveries
4. **Records outcomes** — successful action/error pairs get higher priority next time

Inspect learnings: `GET http://localhost:3001/api/kdp/recovery/learnings`

Publish responses include `recoveryLog` when recoveries ran.

## Cover upload shows NOT_STARTED

Ensure print settings (trim size, ink/paper type) are set before cover upload. The content flow now waits for hidden `publisher_cover[status]=SUCCESS` before continuing.

## Playwright / Chromium

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

Headless updates; login uses visible browser (`headless: false` in login.ts).

## Port in use

Change `KDP_SERVER_PORT` in `.env`.
